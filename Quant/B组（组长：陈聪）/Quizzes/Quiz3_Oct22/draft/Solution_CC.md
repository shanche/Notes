###P3
Solve this problem backward. If one toseese the 3rd time, his expectation is $(1+2+3+4+5+6)/6=3.5$. 
That means in the second toss if he gets 4,5,6 he should stop at 2nd toss. If he gets 1,2,3 he should use the 3rd chance.
So in the 2nd toss he has 1/6 chance to get 4,5,6 seperately and 1/2 chance to get 3.5. The expectation is 4.25.
That means if in the 1st round he gets 5 or 6 he should stop otherwise continue.
In the 1st round he has 1/6 chance to get 5 or 6 seperately and 2/3 chance to get 4.25.
The expectation is (5+6)/6+ 4.25*2/3 = 14/3=4.67.

The value of the game is 4.67.
